# Chutes and Ladders with Laravel Verbs

This is a learning project to explore event sourcing in Laravel using [Verbs](https://verbs.thunk.dev/), a powerful event sourcing package.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to implement the classic game "Chutes and Ladders" (also known as "Snakes and Ladders") while learning:

-   Event sourcing principles
-   Laravel Verbs package implementation
-   Game state management through events

## About Verbs

Verbs is a Laravel package that enables event sourcing, allowing you to derive application state from a sequence of events. It's particularly well-suited for:

-   Applications with complex business logic (like games)
-   Systems that need to track state changes
-   Projects that require full auditability
